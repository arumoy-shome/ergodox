# Ergodox Ez Layout

This is my current Ergodox Ez [layout](layout.pdf).

## Features

* symmetry is favoured, allows you to get familiar with the layout quickly
* keys on the edges of the keyboard are avoided
* allows you to stay really close to the home row
* minimal hand stretching and movement required
* use of layers for navigation, numbers and symbols
* navigation follow vim key bindings (checkout layers 2 and 4) i.e `h, j, k, l`
  to navigate
* symbols ordered based on frequency of usage for example, all braces are kept
  under the index and middle finger (check layer 1)
